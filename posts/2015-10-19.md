You can also easily create numbered lists:

1. First idea

3. Third idea

##Example of Embedded Figures
You can easily reference data figures that are themselves also saved in GitHub and version controlled.

##Example of Code Snippets
It is easy to add snippets of some code you wrote today:

```perl
  #!/usr/bin/perl
  #
  # The traditional first program.

  # Strict and warnings are recommended.
  use strict;
  use warnings;

  # Print a message.
  print "Hello, World!\n";
```

##Example of Tables
You can easily add formatted tables to your notebook:

| Column One | Column Two |
|:----------:|:----------:|
|     50     |     100    |
|     25     |     200    |
|     55     |     500    |
|     15     |     150    |
